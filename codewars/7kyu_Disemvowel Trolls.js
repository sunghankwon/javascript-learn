/*
Trolls are attacking your comment section!

A common way to deal with this situation is to remove all of the vowels from the trolls' comments, neutralizing the threat.

Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.

For example, the string "This website is for losers LOL!" would become "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!".

Note: for this kata y isn't considered a vowel.

function disemvowel(str) {
  var answer = "";
  for (i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {
    if (
      str[i] === "a" ||
      str[i] === "e" ||
      str[i] === "i" ||
      str[i] === "o" ||
      str[i] === "u" ||
      str[i] === "A" ||
      str[i] === "E" ||
      str[i] === "I" ||
      str[i] === "O" ||
      str[i] === "U"
    ) {
      continue;
    } else {
      answer += str[i];
    }
  }
  return answer;
